    Some simple object manipulation and use of promises (with a fake backend emulated with the use of setTimeout).
    Promise Promise Promise......master Promise
    Mostly questions about promises and related stuff.

    Implement JSON.stringify, solve circular dependency.

    Asynchronous programming concept.
    Code pair with one of the engineer (1hr) - 2-3 scenario-based questions.
    Implement a data structure
    How would you allow for multiple promises to be processed at the same time?
        Actually Promise.all is not the only one, just depend on what you need, if your promises need to execute with a depedency grade, so Promise.all will work fine, but if you just want to execute all of them, so you should use Promise.allSettled , so will return a promise when all the passed promises were resolved or rejected, so Promise.all will stop de execution if any of the promise failed.
