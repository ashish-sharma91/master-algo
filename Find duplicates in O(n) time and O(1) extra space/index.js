// Find duplicates in O(n) time and O(1) extra space | Set 1
// Given an array of n elements which contains elements from 0 to n-1, with any of these numbers appearing any number of times. Find these repeating numbers in O(n) and using only constant memory space.
// Example:

// Input : n = 7 and array[] = {1, 2, 3, 1, 3, 6, 6}
// Output: 1, 3, 6

// Explanation: The numbers 1 , 3 and 6 appears more
// than once in the array.

// Input : n = 5 and array[] = {1, 2, 3, 4 ,3}
// Output: 3

// Explanation: The number 3 appears more than once
// in the array.
